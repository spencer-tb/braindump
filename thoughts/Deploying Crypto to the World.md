The longer I stay in the space the more I appreciate and understand the real world use cases of blockchain. But how do we transition the world to one that is crypto native?

How does one get all leading nations of the world to adopt and update their societal and economic models to use crypto?

While I understand that the so called "flippening" of the dollar to BTC is statistically probable, I don't believe it is the best case scenario for nation adoption. Although its definitely a force pushing us towards the direction of a crypto first world. 

## AI Towards Crypto

Is AI the centralising force that inevitably leads to mass crypto adoption? If you are somewhat used to LLMs one can easily spot a trend of AI generated content online. Although it is getting more difficult to spot what is AI and what is human. This can be and I believe already is being  weaponised to sway opinions online. Remember Cambridge Analytica? AI generated personalities can be deployed at scale to favour strong political arguments if the compute exists.

You may think, "well bots can be spotted online easily". Hmm not anymore. Using a simple AI proxy swapping service, or AI driven captcha solving services (think BrightData) can easily bypass bot detection. This is using AI to bypass AI.

This force of AI generated content, weaponised by countries, leads those favouring to defend themselves towards and on-chain solution. "Web3.0"... yep it ain't buzzword anymore. Proof of humanity will be necessary. Crypto will be necessary. Thanks AI :D


## Crypto Gaming

The youth is our future. We already have many games without crypto that have in-game market places. Why do these marketplaces not adopt tokens on chain for in game assets that can be exchanged? Well we will soon. Many large game studios are looking widely towards this level of adoption.

The model for this will be quite simple. Subscription service, maybe on the token level.

To play game X you pay 0.0001 ETH per month. All users paying to play game X will pool funds together on the back-end. These funds will be distributed towards users based winner/losers or plain luck. On a low-level it sounds like gambling but if you are good at the game you will be rewarded.

Many games are already built like this. On-chain means less corruption.

What am I getting at. If the gaming industry is trending towards crypto adoption, where more and more kids in the western world are hooked to these games. It leads to our youth learning how to use crypto's underlying technology.

If people learn the tools required to use crypto at an early age they will find it very easy to use and understand as an adult. Gaming solves the UX problem.
