### Verkle Transition Tests

Continue-ing from the notes added here: [[18.06.24]]

To further validate the dummy block implementation we will utilize the StateDiff from the witness to verify that the updated keys within the VKT are indeed correct.

We will re-add the dummy blocks for blockchain tests.

```python
if fork is EIP6800Transition:
	self.blocks = []
	# Add a dummy block fork on the fork transition
	# Each subsequent test block will automatically increment by 12 seconds
	self.blocks.append(Block(timestamp=HexNumber(fork.transition_at())))
	# Add a X dummy blocks at the end of the test block
	post_blocks = 5
	for _ in range(post_blocks):
		self.blocks.append(Block())
```

Verifying the tests again to double check what's wrong.

As from before we have 9 failing tests of which only 3 are distinct; as there pre alloc MPT is equivalent (and the dummy blocks contain nothing to change the state). These can be concentrated down to the following below.

All invalid merkle root errors. Some occur on the 1st block after transition (block 2) and the others on the 3rd (block 4).

#### Failing Dummy Block Cases

Here we are filling our existing tests but removing the test blocks and replacing them with dummy blocks (those which have nothing to affect the state). Note that the history storage contract will still affect the state.

A) `test_warm_coinbase_call_out_of_gas[fork_EIP6800Transition-blockchain_test-DELEGATECALL-sufficient_gas]`

The failure occurs on block 4 where block 1 occurs on the transition block:
`genesis -> block 1 (transition block) -> block 2 -> block 3 -> block 4 (failure)`

 Here is its pre state.
```json
	"pre": {
            "0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe": {
                "nonce": "0x01",
                "balance": "0x00",
                "code": "0x60203611603157600143035f35116029575f356120000143116029576120005f3506545f5260205ff35b5f5f5260205ff35b5f5ffd00",
                "storage": {}
            },
            "0xa94f5374fce5edbc8e2a8697c15331677e6ebf0b": {
                "nonce": "0x00",
                "balance": "0x3635c9adc5dea00000",
                "code": "0x",
                "storage": {}
            },
            "0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc": {
                "nonce": "0x00",
                "balance": "0x00",
                "code": "0x600060006000600060006101006077f1600055",
                "storage": {}
            },
            "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000100": {
                "nonce": "0x00",
                "balance": "0x00",
                "code": "0x6000600060006000416000f450",
                "storage": {}
            }
        },
```

For some reason the insufficient gas case passes where only the `code` for account `0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc` differs by a single hex char:
```json
// sufficient case
"0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc": {
	"nonce": "0x00",
	"balance": "0x00",
	"code": "0x600060006000600060006101006077f1600055",
	"storage": {}
},
// insufficient case
"0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc": {
	"nonce": "0x00",
	"balance": "0x00",
	"code": "0x600060006000600060006101006076f1600055",
	"storage": {}
},
```



B) `test_create_selfdestruct_same_tx[fork_EIP6800Transition-blockchain_test-selfdestruct_contract_initial_balance_0-multiple_calls_single_sendall_recipient-create_opcode_CREATE2]`

As with A) the failure occurs on block 4 where block 1 occurs on the transition block:
`genesis -> block 1 (transition block) -> block 2 -> block 3 -> block 4 (failure)`

There are multiple cases here as they start with the same pre state and use equal dummy blocks). It's pre state is as follows.

```json
"pre": {
	"0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe": {
		"nonce": "0x01",
		"balance": "0x00",
		"code": "0x60203611603157600143035f35116029575f356120000143116029576120005f3506545f5260205ff35b5f5f5260205ff35b5f5ffd00",
		"storage": {}
	},
	"0xa94f5374fce5edbc8e2a8697c15331677e6ebf0b": {
		"nonce": "0x00",
		"balance": "0x056bc75e2d63100000",
		"code": "0x",
		"storage": {}
	},
	"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000abcd": {
		"nonce": "0x00",
		"balance": "0x00",
		"code": "0x610024600081600b8239f3600160005401600055730000000000000000000000000000000000001000ff6000600055",
		"storage": {}
	},
	"0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111": {
		"nonce": "0x00",
		"balance": "0x00",
		"code": "0x600160005401600055730000000000000000000000000000000000001000ff6000600055",
		"storage": {}
	},
	"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001000": {
		"nonce": "0x00",
		"balance": "0x00",
		"code": "0x6000600055",
		"storage": {
			"0x00": "0x01"
		}
	}
},
```

C) `test_create_selfdestruct_same_tx[fork_EIP6800Transition-blockchain_test-selfdestruct_contract_initial_balance_100000-multiple_calls_single_sendall_recipient-create_opcode_CREATE]`

In this case the failure occurs on block 2. The block after the transition block:
`genesis -> block 1 (transition block) -> block 2 (failure)`

As with B) - there are multiple cases here as they start with the same pre state and use equal dummy blocks). C's pre state is as follows.

```json
"pre": {
	"0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe": {
		"nonce": "0x01",
		"balance": "0x00",
		"code": "0x60203611603157600143035f35116029575f356120000143116029576120005f3506545f5260205ff35b5f5f5260205ff35b5f5ffd00",
		"storage": {}
	},
	"0xa94f5374fce5edbc8e2a8697c15331677e6ebf0b": {
		"nonce": "0x00",
		"balance": "0x056bc75e2d63100000",
		"code": "0x",
		"storage": {}
	},
	"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000abcd": {
		"nonce": "0x00",
		"balance": "0x00",
		"code": "0x610024600081600b8239f3600160005401600055730000000000000000000000000000000000001000ff6000600055",
		"storage": {}
	},
	"0x64e2ebd6405af8cb348aec519084d3fff42ebba6": {
		"nonce": "0x00",
		"balance": "0x0186a0",
		"code": "0x",
		"storage": {}
	},
	"0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111": {
		"nonce": "0x00",
		"balance": "0x0186a0",
		"code": "0x600160005401600055730000000000000000000000000000000000001000ff6000600055",
		"storage": {}
	},
	"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001000": {
		"nonce": "0x00",
		"balance": "0x00",
		"code": "0x6000600055",
		"storage": {
			"0x00": "0x01"
		}
	}
},
```

Time to check the witness state diff matches the changes within the vkt from the evm debug dump whilst filling. **This is correct.**

### Dummy Block Fix For C With Additional Failures

For some reason adding a dummy block before the transition block fixes the execution failure on the 2nd block in C):

```python
if fork is EIP6800Transition:
	self.blocks = []
	# NEW: add a dummy block before the transition block
	self.blocks.append(Block(timestamp=HexNumber(fork.transition_at() - 1)))
	# Add a dummy block fork on the fork transition
	# Each subsequent test block will automatically increment by 12 seconds
	self.blocks.append(Block(timestamp=HexNumber(fork.transition_at())))
	# Add a X dummy blocks at the end of the test block
	post_blocks = 5
	for _ in range(post_blocks):
		self.blocks.append(Block())
```

But adds considerably more failures 62 total. These all have the same failure occurrence where the 3rd executed block after the transition block fails with an invalid merkle root error:

```
genesis (shanghai),
block 1 (shanghai),
block 2 (transition block, prague),
block 3,
block 4,
block 5 (failure)
```

Something fishy is going on here.
