### Verkle Transition Tests

Continue-ing with the approach outlined here: [[Transition Test Improvements]]!

We are using the following geth branch for the filling and execution of tests:
https://github.com/gballet/go-ethereum/tree/base-root-last-merkle-root-merge

All verkle changes within EEST have been merged to this branch:
https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/tree/verkle/main

Right now we are filling for naive mid-transition tests. After fixing the execution blocks regarding the correct indexing for test blocks occurring on the Verkle transition block - we now have some failures when filling tests again:
 ![[Pasted image 20240618132513.png]]

Before making creating the fixture when filling this is the new approach:

```python
# Hack for filling naive verkle transition tests
if fork is EIP6800Transition:
	# Add a dummy block before the fork transition
	self.blocks.insert(0, Block(timestamp=HexNumber(fork.transition_at() - 1)))
	# Set timestamp for the next block to verkle transition time
	self.blocks[1].timestamp = HexNumber(fork.transition_at())
	# Increment all other block numbers
	for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks[1:]):
		block.number = HexNumber(i + 2)
	# Add a dummy block at the end of the test blocks
	self.blocks.append(Block())
```

Note we only need to update the first test to block occur on the transition block as the framework will automatically add 12 for each block afterwards, compared to the past block. This is only for blocks that don't have a timestamp defined.

This seems to let us **pass the filling all of the pre-Shanghai and Shanghai tests**, where the first test block for these tests occur on the Verkle transition block. I am not sure why we couldn't before fill these correctly before. The `fork.transition_at()` function was added to `forks.py` and `base_forks.py` in the process.

Pushed to the `verkle/main` branch: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/commit/92590bce8b1b1d635d8a5694de2580fd67bf64bd

Now lets try execute these. Hmm more failures. 

Trying again with filled tests without an additional post dummy block. These all seem to pass. The tests which are failing are those with >1 test block. This is why adding the dummy block caused the errors. Its probably not configured properly.

Update to test why we fail for >1 test block:
```python
if fork is EIP6800Transition:
	# Add a dummy block before the fork transition
	self.blocks.insert(0, Block(timestamp=HexNumber(fork.transition_at() - 1)))
	# Set timestamp for the first test block to verkle transition time
	# Each subsequent test block will automatically increment by 12 seconds
	self.blocks[1].timestamp = HexNumber(fork.transition_at())
	# Increment block numbers accounting for the pre-transition dummy block
	for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks[1:]):
		block.number = HexNumber(i + 2)
	# Add a X dummy blocks at the end of the test block
	post_blocks = 1
	for _ in range(post_blocks):
		self.blocks.append(Block())
```

We pass 54/264 tests when we add a post dummy block. Testing with 5 post dummy blocks to see if we get the same result.

Adding 5 gives us the same failures and looking at the geth consume rlp hive logs I can confirm that for these tests we are failing on the first block after the transition block.

Lets check if we always fail in these cases, i.e post-transition tests. I will add a dummy transition block before the tests blocks so all tests start on the first block after the transition block. Edits for the latter:

```python
if fork is EIP6800Transition:
	# Add a dummy block fork transition before the test blocks
	# Each subsequent test block will automatically increment by 12 seconds
	self.blocks.insert(0, Block(timestamp=HexNumber(fork.transition_at())))
	# Increment block numbers accounting for transition dummy block
	for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks[1:]):
		block.number = HexNumber(i + 2)
	# Add a X dummy blocks at the end of the test block
	post_blocks = 5
	for _ in range(post_blocks):
		self.blocks.append(Block())
```

Filling this type of transition test is passing. Now we need to check execution. For my assumption to be correct, we equivalent failures but on the first test block (first block after the transition). So we get equivalent failures. This implies there is an issue on geth when processing the first block after the transition block.

Lets use dummy block completely to make sure its not an issue with pre-alloc MPT conversion:
```python
if fork is EIP6800Transition:
	self.blocks = []
	# Add a dummy block fork on the fork transition
	# Each subsequent test block will automatically increment by 12 seconds
	self.blocks.append(Block(timestamp=HexNumber(fork.transition_at())))
	# Add a X dummy blocks at the end of the test block
	post_blocks = 5
	for _ in range(post_blocks):
		self.blocks.append(Block())
```


When filling and executing with the latter all tests pass apart from 2 with equal pre-alloc MPTs.
Lets try to resolve these cases on the geth side before continuing back with the real test blocks.

Summarised info for this debugging session:![[Pasted image 20240618161941.png]]

Using this commit: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/commit/33ce1a36271192e49c6f6a27e026518c64ef5427 for the latter.

It looks like for some tests we fill with an input VKT where the value for key/value pairs are padded:
```json
{
    "0x5b5fdfedd6a0e932da408ac7d772a36513d1eee9b9926e52620c43a433aad700": "0x00",
    "0x5b5fdfedd6a0e932da408ac7d772a36513d1eee9b9926e52620c43a433aad701": "0x00",
	...
}
```

Lets check if these tests correspond to our failing tests. No cases with the latter still pass tests.

The issue could be coming from storage in the MPT when converting to VKT. Of the only failures we have (simply with an init pre-MPT alloc and empty dummy blocks) the both seem to have storage present within the pre-MPT. If this is the case we have isolated the problem. More below.

![[Pasted image 20240618164714.png]]


Post meeting with Mario:
- Check stride is not enable.
- Focus only on empty blocks (no txs/withdrawals) only initial mpt
- block 0 alloc input (frozen mpt) should be output from t8n, and input back. We can validate that the frozen mpt stays frozen.
- check the tree-key command works correctly
- check the output alloc from the t8n, that we are parsing it correctly


So it seems everything is working as expect for dummy blocks. We have the history storage contract updating the state every block which is as expect. This is why we have multiple addition to the VKT. I am going to try and use the StateDiff from the witness to further verifying the tree additions.

## Adding a second run for legacy consensus tests

After the recent changes to `ethereum/tests` we are now only running the main-net fork tests within hive using the consensus simulator (~22k tests):

![[Pasted image 20240618140318.png]]

We need to additionally update the hivetests CI to run the consensus simulator for the legacy tests.

This is the short term fix. Once we port over all tests to be runnable from EEST consume we can improve this. Running legacy tests weekly for example.

https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/596

It could be worth doing the latter instead as its the step in the right direction.
