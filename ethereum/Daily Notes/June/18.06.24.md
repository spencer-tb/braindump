### Verkle Transition Tests

Continue-ing with the approach outlined here: [[Transition Test Improvements]]!

We are using the following geth branch for the filling and execution of tests:
https://github.com/gballet/go-ethereum/tree/base-root-last-merkle-root-merge

All verkle changes within EEST have been merged to this branch:
https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/tree/verkle/main

Right now we are filling for naive mid-transition tests. After fixing the execution blocks regarding the correct indexing for test blocks occurring on the Verkle transition block - we now have some failures when filling tests again:

Before making creating the fixture when filling this is the new approach:

```python
# Hack for filling naive verkle transition tests
if fork is EIP6800Transition:
	# Add a dummy block before the fork transition
	self.blocks.insert(0, Block(timestamp=HexNumber(fork.transition_at() - 1)))
	# Set timestamp for the next block to verkle transition time
	self.blocks[1].timestamp = HexNumber(fork.transition_at())
	# Increment all other block numbers
	for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks[1:]):
		block.number = HexNumber(i + 2)
	# Add a dummy block at the end of the test blocks
	self.blocks.append(Block())
```

Note we only need to update the first test to block occur on the transition block as the framework will automatically add 12 for each block afterwards, compared to the past block. This is only for blocks that don't have a timestamp defined.

This seems to let us **pass the filling all of the pre-Shanghai and Shanghai tests**, where the first test block for these tests occur on the Verkle transition block. I am not sure why we couldn't before fill these correctly before. The `fork.transition_at()` function was added to `forks.py` and `base_forks.py` in the process.

Pushed to the `verkle/main` branch: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/commit/92590bce8b1b1d635d8a5694de2580fd67bf64bd

Now lets try execute these. Hmm more failures. 

Trying again with filled tests without an additional post dummy block. These all seem to pass. The tests which are failing are those with >1 test block. This is why adding the dummy block caused the errors. Its probably not configured properly.

Update to test why we fail for >1 test block:
```python
 # Hack for filling naive verkle transition tests
if fork is EIP6800Transition:
	# Add a dummy block before the fork transition
	self.blocks.insert(0, Block(timestamp=HexNumber(fork.transition_at() - 1)))
	# Set timestamp for the first test block to verkle transition time
	# Each subsequent test block will automatically increment by 12 seconds
	self.blocks[1].timestamp = HexNumber(fork.transition_at())
	# Increment block numbers accounting for the pre-transition dummy block
	for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks[1:]):
		block.number = HexNumber(i + 2)
	# Add a X dummy blocks at the end of the test block
	post_blocks = 1
	for _ in range(post_blocks):
		self.blocks.append(Block())
```

We pass 54/264 tests when we add a post dummy block. Testing with 5 post dummy blocks to see if we get the same result. I can confirm that for these tests we are failing on the block after the transition block.





## Adding a second run for legacy consensus tests

After the recent changes to `ethereum/tests` we are now only running the mainnet fork tests within hive using the consensus simulator (~22k tests):

We need to additionally update the hivetests CI to run the consensus simulator for the legacy tests.

This is the short term fix. Once we port over all tests to be runnable from EEST consume we can improve this. Running legacy tests weekly for example.

https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/596

It could be worth doing the latter instead as its the step in the right direction.
