Currently expensive real world art assets are only accessible to those with significant levels of personal liquidity. This idea would aim fractionalize the exchange of RWArt, in a similar way to housing.

Protocol or organisation to facilitate art exchange/transactions. Art of high value is required to be kept "underground" so the art doesn't deteriorate. Maybe the idea only really works where a trusted centralized entity holds the art in unknown locations around the world. Owning a significant portion of the fractionalized art liquidity (majority or super majority), such that it can exchange these fractions in real-time with anyone around the world, AMM for expensive art pieces.

Owners would obtain NFTs relative to their ownership of the art pieces. This could additionally be thought of as a futuristic museum (the centralized entity that owns these pieces).

The org/protocol would gain value when users exchange the fractionalized art. This would be used to collect more art and look after existing pieces. Fund security to protect it. Organize events for large fractionalized art piece holders etc.

Maybe worth investing in, ARTFI token lauched on bitget recently. Although Dubai entity feels kinda scammy. I would prefer this idea to be more of a non-profit for Art movement.
