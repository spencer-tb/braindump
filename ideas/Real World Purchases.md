Whilst eating a Bahn Mi on the relaxed streets on Hoi An, some thought came to mind regarding how existing real world purchases could potentially benefit from the adoption of crypto.

Lets say company X is valued based on the price of its native token. This could be Starbucks or Nike etc.

Anytime someone purchases a physical product from brand X they additionally get some of the brands token. I.e for 1%, they purchase a shoe for $100. They get $1 of the brands token. Ideally this would be vested over a period.

Brand consumers will therefore be incentivised to buy products from brands they a) believe in b) will be a good long term investment. Tokens could be collectively pooled together against other users who purchase a product to facilitate an additional marketplace.

Consumers could additionally sell these tokens to other users who chose to buy a similar product. Buyers are incentivised to buy products from companies that are new over those that are old. The upside from buying a new brand that you believe in would out weight that of an existing brand.

Its could been seen as a new way to crowdsource funds for brands and products. Ideally there is some mechanism that rewards each of those involved in creating the product appropriately. Coffee farmers, logistics and transport etc.

1. **Enhanced Brand Loyalty**: Consumers are incentivised to make repeat purchases to accumulate tokens.
2. **Increased Brand Equity**: The token's market performance can reflect and enhance the brand's value.
3. **Consumer Engagement**: Tokens foster a more engaged and invested consumer base.
4. **Market Differentiation**: Early adoption of this system can attract tech-savvy consumers and differentiate the brand from competitors.
5. **Stability through Vesting**: Tokens are vested over a period (e.g., 5 years) before they can be sold, promoting price stability.
